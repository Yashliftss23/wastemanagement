            <h2 class="biodegradable">Biodegradable</h2>
            <p class="center">Biodegradable waste is a type of waste, typically originating from plant or animal
                sources, which may be degraded by other living organisms.It mainly includes kitchen waste (spoiled food,
                trimmings, inedible parts), ash, soil, dung and other plant matter. In waste management, it also
                includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria into the soil. The whole process is natural. Therefore, the
                environmental issues and risks caused by biodegradable wastes are low.
                Generally, biodegradation (biodegradable process) occurs naturally which makes it different from composting. And most biodegradable decompositions are eco-friendly.

            <h2 class="nonbiodegradable">Non Biodegradable </h2>
            <p class="center">A Non-Biodegradable material can be defined as a kind of substance which cannot be broken
                down by natural organisms and acts as a source of pollution. They remain on earth for thousands of years without any degradation.
                Since non-biodegradable wastes are not Eco-friendly, they need to be replaced. Scientists have
                brought forward many ideas like biodegradable plastics, etc. As it is an inorganic substance, so it does not get decomposed or degraded in the environment
                resulting in the pollution of land and water ecosystem. It also creates a very severe effect on aquatic life. Therefore, all kinds of inorganic wastes come under non-biodegradable waste.

            <h2 class="environment"># Effects of Waste Material on Environment </h2>
            <p class="centerr">
                Waste materials have a very adverse effect on our environment. They pollute the environment in which we
                live and make it inhabitable for existence.

                These waste materials not only pollute our environment but also pollute the environments of other
                animals living in them making it difficult for them to survive. The billions of tonnes of waste
                generated every year find their way into landfills or into the sea where they make the organism living
                in that environment suffer and thus disturb the balance of life in their environment.

                The smoke produced by vehicles, factories, and others makes the air polluted which leads to various
                diseases in humans and other. It can cause irritation in the eyes, lung diseases, difficulty in
                breathing, and other problems.

                Thus, it is clear that waste materials have an adverse effect on our environment. So it is our
                responsibility to clean our environment.</p>
            <br>

            <h2 class="environment"># Treatments of Waste Material </h2>
            <p class="centerr">
                Both biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials if not treated properly can cause harmful effects on
                our environment. Thus proper treatment of the waste material is a must. We must make sure that the waste
                we produce is decomposed in the most scientific way damaging the environment the least.
            </p>

            <h2 class="environment"># Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle </h2>
            <p class="centerr">
                3R or Reduce, Reuse and Recycle is the way to remove waste materials from the human society or
                environment. We can not directly just ban all the materials which are harmful to us and our surroundings
                as they are required for various purposes but to make sure they do not end up in seas, or landfills, we
                must do some things. So to achieve all these purposes environmentalists came up with an idea about 3R
                (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle). Letâ€™s learn about it,<br>

                <u><b>Reduce:</b></u>

                We must reduce the use of harmful chemicals and plastics and must switch to safer alternatives as early
                as possible. For example, reducing the use of plastic bags and promoting the use of jute bags. <br>

                <u><b>Reuse:</b> </u>

                We must reuse harmful plastics substances so that they may not end up in the seas or landfills. For
                example, we can use paint buckets (after cleaning) for storing water and other essentials. <br>

                <u><b>Recycle:</b></u>

                We should recycle the waste materials to be used again and again. For example, aluminium can be used
                again, we can recycle old newspapers and others.
